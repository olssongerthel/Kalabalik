_Kalabalik_ is an **unofficial** REST API implementation for the Swedish ERP system [FDT Avance](http://fdt.se/affarssystem/).

It exposes a number of entities that may be relevant to other systems, and makes it possible to build applications around it or connect FDT with external systems. Entities exposed are (among others):

- products (artiklar)
- orders (fakturor)
- customers (kunder)
- purchase orders (inköpsorder)

..and more. Launch Kalabalik and visit the frontpage of the API to see all endpoints.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (to be able to run the REST server)
- MS SQL access (to be able to get the data)

Kalabalik only supports Avance using MS SQL as data storage.

## Installation instructions

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/olssongerthel/Kalabalik/releases) or clone the repo.
2. Unzip/Unpack and go to the folder
3. Copy and rename config.default.js: `cp config/config.default.js config.js` and add your database credentials to config.js.
4. Install dependencies: `npm install --production`
5. Run Kalabalik: `node server.js`
6. Go check it out at `http://localhost:3000` in a browser of choice.

**Optional**: Add username and password to config.js to enable basic authentication. If you don’t want to use 3000 as port number you can change that as well in config.js.

If you want to run Kalabalik on a Windows server, [IIS Node](https://github.com/tjanczuk/iisnode) is recommended as it makes Node.js and Windows work very well together.

## Filtering responses
Kalabalik supports filtering on any database column using pipe delimited values. It supports standard SQL operators such as `=`, `>`, `<`, `LIKE`, `IS NOT` etc. There are some caveats, for example using `LIKE` with the wildcard sign `%` would break the URL so `$` is used instead of `%`.

Example 1: Single filter
`/orders?filter=Status=3`

Example 2: Multiple filters
`/orders?filter=Status=3|Dellevererad=1|`

Example 3: Filter on on orders from a certain date
`/orders?filter=Orderdatum>"2015-09-04"`

Example 4: Filter on on products containing the word _chair_
`/products?filter=Benämning_0 LIKE "$chair$"`

Use 1 or 0 for TRUE/FALSE when filtering. Use quotes for strings.

### Additional filtering

There is another, more advanced form of filtering that can be done if sufficient database knowledge is at hand. It uses "IN" statements based on results of other queries. If, for example you want to filter the order list for orders containing a line item containing the word "bag", you would filter like this:

`/orders?subFilter=InköpsNr[supplier:InkK:InköpsNr][Benämning LIKE "$bag$"]`

or if you'd like to filter products that are in stock:

`/products?subFilter=ArtikelNr[invoicing:LagerSaldo:ArtikelNr][Lager > 0 AND LagerställeID = 1]`

The subFilter value is constructed like this:

`property[database:table:column][where]`

- property: The property to match the resulting value to.
- database: The "name" of the database, see the config file.
- table: The database table to perform the query on.
- column: The column used to extract the value that is matched to the propery.
- where: An SQL 'WHERE' statement.

## Controlling the pages and results

There are four available parameters related to results:

`perPage` can be set to any integer below 10.000. Default is 25.
`page` is the actual page number. This value is available in the metadata on each list result.
`orderBy` is the property you wish to order the results by. Some indexes have a default that is hidden.
`direction` used in combination with orderBy. `ASC` or `DESC` ar e valid options here, and `DESC` is mostly the default.

## Updating entities

Updating an entity is risky since we're dealing with direct database access. If an endpoint supports PUT, then use it carefully. *Extra* fields might be easy and risk free to update, but keep in mind that there might be a lot of things going around when for example an order is saved in FDT Avance - stuff that is not taken into account for in this API.

To update an entity, submit the changes in JSON format as request body, i.e:

**Content type:** application/json

**Method:** PUT

**URL:** http://api.example.com/purchase-orders/2004

**Body**
```
{
  "Notat": "This is an example text added to the notat field on the purchase order with id 2004."
}
```
Note: Sub-entities (such as line items) cannot be updated this way.

## Project status

Kalabalik is currently under development and is subject to change. Not safe for production use.
